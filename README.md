## Description

The visitor-management-system provides an interface where a visitor can either put in their details and their host's details to check in, or provide their visitor ID to check out.

The Flask forms in the front end pass the entered data to the backend and the check in time and check out time is automatically calculated by the program and stored in the MongoDB database.

The interface also has a page for the Admin where the whole database can be viewed from time to time by providing the Admin ID.
